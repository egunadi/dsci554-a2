# DSCI 554 Assignment 2

[EbenGunadi_Assignment2.pptx](EbenGunadi_Assignment2.pptx) contains a presentation of the lab content.

Contents were procured via a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook, [UN_Data_Analysis.ipynb](UN_Data_Analysis.ipynb). Locally, this notebook was run on a Python 3.7.16 environment, but any newer version should work.

## Working with Notebooks

### ðŸš€ Getting Started with JupyterLab

Read [JupyterLab Documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) to get started.

- JupiterLab notebooks are made of two basic types of cells:
  - `CODE`: code  cells
  - `TEXT`: markdown cells
- Insert new cells: Using the Dropdown in the above toolbar
- Keyboard Shortcuts: see under `Run` menu

See also [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) for an online version of JupyterLab.

A good starting point is the [Welcome To Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
