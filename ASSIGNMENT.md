# DSCI 554 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Homework Assignment

## Description

__Dataset:__ United Nations Data

__Objective:__ Perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on population and economic indicators across different countries using the United Nations data. You can use R, Python, and/or Observable notebooks or a combination. 

## Tasks:

1. Data Collection:
    - Access the United Nations data repository or API to retrieve relevant datasets on population and economic indicators for various countries.
    - Download or fetch the necessary datasets in a format suitable for analysis (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON).
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
    - Load the datasets into your preferred data analysis tool (e.g., Python with pandas, R).
    - Inspect the data for missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Address missing values and outliers using appropriate techniques.
    - Merge or join datasets as needed based on common variables (e.g., country code).
    - Document how you clean and preprocess the data using Markdown in the notebooks.
3. Descriptive Statistics:
    - Calculate summary statistics for relevant variables such as population size, GDP, etc.
    - Create histograms, box plots, or density plots as appropriate to visualize the distribution of these variables.
4. Data Visualization:
    - Create scatter plots or bubble plots to explore relationships between population and economic indicators (e.g., GDP per capita).
    - Generate bar charts or histograms to compare demographics or economic performance across countries.
    - Generate heatmaps or choropleth maps to visualize regional patterns in population distribution or economic performance.
5. Time Series Analysis:
    - Analyze time series data for key indicators, e.g., calculate rolling averages or growth rates and compound annual growth rates (CAGR), to identify periods of significant change.
    - Plot time series graphs to visualize trends and changes over time.
6. Correlation and Regression:
    - Compute correlation coefficients between population and economic indicators.
    - Generate regression plots to understand the relationship between population and a specific economic indicator.
7. Cluster Analysis:
    - Utilize clustering techniques (e.g., K-means) to group countries based on population and economic characteristics.
    - Visualize clusters on a scatter plot or map.
8. Interpretation and Insights:
    - Summarize your findings and insights from the exploratory analysis.
    - Discuss any interesting patterns, relationships, or anomalies you discovered.
    - Reflect on the implications of your analysis for policy or decision-making.

## Submission

- Prepare a comprehensive report in Google Sheets that includes your analysis, visualizations, and interpretations.
- Document and commit your notebooks **without executing them** (not to have to upload large notebook files to the repository) to this repository.
- Provide in the `README.md` links to the report and list the notebooks you have used with a short description of their purpose.

## Rubric

For each task in the description:

| Quality       | Points | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Sophisticated | 4-5    | All task asks are provided according to the task description, analysis is well performed, visualization forms are appropriate to the function, and well-formed, findings and insights are well summarized and presented in the report, notebooks are well documented and presented in the `README.md` |
| Competent     | 2-3    | Most task asks are provided, analysis and visualization are competent, but with room for improvement, findings and insights are partially summarized and presented in the report, notebooks are documented and listed in the `README.md` |
| Needs work    | 0-1    | Few task asks are provided, analysis and visualization lack clarity and depth, findings and insights are unclear or missing, notebooks are poorly documented and presented in the `README.md` |

## Homework Guidelines

- Homework repository must be updated before the deadline
- Commits after the deadline will not be considered unless requested
- Late policy: 10% of total available points per each late day; duration less than 24 hours counts as one whole day
